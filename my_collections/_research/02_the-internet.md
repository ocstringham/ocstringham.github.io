The Internet is a vast source of data on the wildlife trade. Data collected from the Internet can inform conservation, biosecurity, and law enforcement efforts. Yet, collecting data from the Internet has been an underutilized approach.
I created a working guide for using the Internet to quantify wildlife trade. This guide outlines how to find relevant websites and collect data.
