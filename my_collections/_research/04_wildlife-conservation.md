Wildlife populations face numerous threats to their existence including habitat destruction, climate change, poaching, and invasive species. I study the consequences of wildlife trade on wildlife persistance. In particular, I explore the fate of certain desirable species that are harvest for the pet trade. Also, I use quantative population models to determine the extinction fate of populations under different management scenarios. One example includes modelling the effects of installing predator fences for the endangered piping plover populations.
