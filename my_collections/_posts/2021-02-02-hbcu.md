This week I explored the TidyTuesday dataset of the week: Fall enrollment in degree-granting historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU). I plotted the proportion of student enrollment by gender over time. Plot made in R with ggplot2. Code can be found [here](https://github.com/ocstringham/tidy_tuesday/blob/main/scripts/2021-02-02-hbcu.R). 

Read more about the gender gap at HBCUs [here](https://hbcubuzz.com/2020/07/black-men-the-minority-at-hbcus/). Please consider donating to HBCUs, to help fund student's financial assistance programs: [https://thehbcufoundation.org/donate/](https://thehbcufoundation.org/donate/).
