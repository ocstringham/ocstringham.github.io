Plot made in R with ggplot2 and converted to html using ggiraph. Code can be found here." />

      <p>This week I used a <a href="https://data.world/aerispaha/the-bachelor-contestants/workspace/file?filename=historical_bachelor_contestants.csv">dataset</a> of contestants on the TV show <em>The Bachelor</em> (&gt;20 seasons). I plotted the age of contestants across seasons with available data. Basically, the age of contestants has not changed over time(linear regression backs this up). The average age is between 25 and 27 with some variation from 21 to 34. On the plot, the dots show the average age and vertical lines represent 95 quantile intervals.
